## part 1
- run the game
- investigate and modify the game tiles
- create new tile variants

```
        ╔═══╗       ║      ╔═╦═╗
        ║   ║     ══╬══    ╠═╬═╣
        ╚═══╝       ║      ╚═╩═╝
```

- extreme: calculate the connections

## part 2
- run the game
- theory: HTML/CSS as data projection
- modify the game by code
- modify the game by URL
- new/update component - win / loss message
- new/update component - the counter components to fractions
- add the new tile variants (... also serialization)
- game logic - do not allow 360 tile rotation (4 clicks) more than once
- game logic - locked tile (+ visualization)
- advanced: game logic - detect fully closed "pipes" to win the game

## part 3
- run the UI tests
- theory: quality + speed + CI / CD, test types + test pyramid
- implement UI test for custom game
- implement unit test for some new game logic
